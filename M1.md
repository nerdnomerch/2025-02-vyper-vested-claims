# lack of validation of the proof length in `_verify_proof` function

## Summary
lack of validation of the proof length in `_verify_proof` function

## Vulnerability Details
The `_verify_proof` function does not validate the length of the proof array. If the proof array is empty, the function will still compute a hash and compare it to the merkle_root.

This can lead to false positives where an empty proof is accepted as valid for certain leaves.
```vyper
def _verify_proof(proof: DynArray[bytes32, 20], leaf: bytes32) -> bool:
    """
    @notice This function is used to verify the merkle proof
    @param proof: DynArray[bytes32, 20], the merkle proof
    @param leaf: bytes32, the leaf node
    @return bool: True if the proof is valid
    """
    computed_hash: bytes32 = leaf
    for proof_element: bytes32 in proof:
        computed_hash = self._hash_pair(computed_hash, proof_element)
    return computed_hash == self.merkle_root
```

## Impact
An attacker could submit an empty proof and potentially claim tokens they are not entitled to, depending on the structure of the Merkle tree.

## Tools Used
Manual analysis

## Recommendations
Add a check to reject empty proofs
